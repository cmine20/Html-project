        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi there! My name is <strong>Nilo Jr. Olang</strong> and I am a
          Bachelor of Science in Computer Science graduate student.
          <br /><br />I have always been passionate about technology and
          problem-solving, which is what drew me to the field of computer
          science. In my studies, I have focused on topics such as data
          structures, algorithms, programming languages, and software
          engineering.<br /><br />
          Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the
          latest developments in the tech industry and tinkering with new
          technologies in my free time.<br /><br />
          I am also an avid learner and am always looking for new ways to expand
          my knowledge and skills. <br /><br />In the future, I hope to use my
          skills and expertise to make a positive impact in the tech industry,
          whether that be through developing innovative software solutions or
          helping others to learn and grow in their own careers. <br /><br />I
          am excited to see where my studies and interests will take me, and I
          am confident that my degree in computer science will open up a world
          of opportunities for me.

              Upon visiting the website, users will typically be prompted to
              either log in or create a new account. To create an account, users
              will need to provide some personal information, such as their name
              and email address, and create a username and password. Once the
              account is created, users can log in using their username and
              password.<br /><br />

              Once logged in, users will typically be directed to their
              dashboard, which is a personalized interface that allows them to
              access and manage their account and any associated features or
              content. The dashboard may contain links to various pages or
              resources within the website, as well as options for managing
              their account settings and preferences.<br /><br />

              Some examples of websites that have login and dashboard accounts
              include social media platforms, online forums, and online
              marketplaces. These types of websites often allow users to create
              and manage profiles, post and share content, and interact with
              other users. Some may also allow users to purchase products or
              services, track their order history, or manage their account and
              payment information.
