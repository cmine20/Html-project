              <h3>Gabriel Suarez Libay</h3>
              <p>
                Hello, I am currently a student at
                <span>Surigao del Norte State University</span>
                pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science degree. I
                have always been interested in technology and computer science,
                and I am excited to continue learning and growing in this field.
                In my free time, I enjoy playing a variety of computer games,
                from first-person shooters to strategy games. I also enjoy
                following the latest trends and updates in the gaming industry.
                Outside of my studies and hobbies, I enjoy spending time with my
                friends and family, and I am always open to trying new things
                and exploring new places.

              <p>
                Genshin Impact is an open-world, action role-playing game that
