        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I have always been passionate about technology and problem-solving,
          which is what drew me to the field of computer science. In my studies,
          I am currently focused on topics such as network configurations,
          troubleshoot performance issues, troubleshoot computer hardware, web
          development and programming languages.<br /><br />
          Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy staying up-to-date on the
          latest developments in the tech industry and tinkering with new
          technologies in my free time. I am also an avid learner and am always
          looking for new ways to expand my knowledge and skills. <br /><br />In
          the future, I hope to use my skills and expertise to make a positive
          impact in the tech industry, whether that be through developing
          innovative software solutions or helping others to learn and grow in
          their own careers. <br /><br />I am excited to see where my studies
          and interests will take me, and I am confident that my degree in
          computer science will open up a world of opportunities for me.

              Upon visiting the website, users will typically be prompted to
              either log in or create a new account. To create an account, users
              will need to provide some personal information, such as their name
              and email address, and create a username and password. Once the
              account is created, users can log in using their username and
              password.<br /><br />

              Once logged in, users will typically be directed to their
              dashboard, which is a personalized interface that allows them to
              access and manage their account and any associated features or
              content. The dashboard may contain links to various pages or
              resources within the website, as well as options for managing
              their account settings and preferences.<br /><br />

              Some examples of websites that have login and dashboard accounts
              include social media platforms, online forums, and online
              marketplaces. These types of websites often allow users to create
              and manage profiles, post and share content, and interact with
              other users. Some may also allow users to purchase products or
              services, track their order history, or manage their account and
              payment information.

                  <p>
                    This is a Calculator java program that allows the user to
                    perform basic arithmetic operations on four numbers. It
                    reads input from the user using the Scanner class and runs
                    in a loop until the user decides to exit. The program
                    prompts the user to enter four numbers and an operator, and
                    then performs the corresponding operation on the numbers. It
                    prints the result of the calculation and asks the user if
                    they want to try again. If the user enters "YES" or "yes",
                    the program will run again. Otherwise, it will terminate.

                    the name, price, and quantity of each product, and their
                    payment amount. It calculates the total cost of each product
                    by multiplying the price by the quantity, calculates the VAT
                    on the total amount using a rate of 12%, and calculates the
                    change the user will receive by subtracting the total amount
                    from the payment amount. The program displays the receipt on
